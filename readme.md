Challenge is described at https://jsainsburyplc.github.io/serverside-test/

Basically scrape HTML to return JSON, through a Java CLI app

HtmlUnit seems to be an appropriate tool, with good tutorials:     https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/introduction-to-web-scraping-with-java/

The document to be scraped is at:

https://jsainsburyplc.github.io/serverside-test/site/www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/berries-cherries-currants6039.html

CLI could feasibly take in options

- `-w` / `--webpage` to specify the page to scrape (must be similar to the example berries-cherries page)
-  to be completed...
